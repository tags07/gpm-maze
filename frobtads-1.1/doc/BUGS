Known bugs.  Don't report them; fix them! :)

  - On some versions of GCC in combination with certain x86 CPUs, the
    Tads 3 VM will crash at startup when an optimization level of -O2
    or higher is used.  This can be fixed by using the
    "-fno-strict-aliasing" option of g++ (gcc isn't affected).

  - Currently, the interpreter cannot display characters outside the
    7-bit ASCII range.

  - When a game has set a timeout for an input, and the terminal the
    interpreter runs in is resized, the timeout will be reset to its
    initial value rather than the remaining time.

  - The "--no-defcolors" option doesn't work with all curses versions.

  - On some systems it is not possible to bundle multi-media resources
    into the image file using the -recurse command line option of
    t3make.  The systems affected are those that lack the <glob.h>
    system header.

  - An interpreter crash (a segfault for example) is likely to leave the
    terminal in a weird state.  Entering "reset" (even if you can't see
    what you're typing) followed by a "unicode_start" (if applicable for
    your system) should bring the terminal back to normal.

  - Plain-mode (pure stdout output without curses) is only partially
    supported (frob --interface plain) and buggy.
