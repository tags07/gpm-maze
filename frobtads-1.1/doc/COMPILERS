There is no documentation on the TADS programming languages included in
any of the FrobTADS packages.  Luckily, the TADS homepage offers
various downloads and links:

http://www.tads.org
  The TADS homepage; has the latest news, updates and documentation for
  everything TADS-related.

http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc
  The TADS 3 Bookshelf.  Everything you need to know about writing IF
  in TADS 3 can be found there.  A must-visit.  It contains various
  books, browsable online (HTML) and downloadable (PDF).

  The TADS 2 Author's Manual (HTML format).

  This leads to the online-version of the TADS 2 Author's Manual.


Using the compilers
===================

The compilers can be invoked with:

  tadsc   (TADS 2 compiler)
  t3make  (TADS 3 compiler)

Note that, unlike the interpreter, the compilers don't support GNU-like
command line options, which means that "short options" aren't available.
For example, use "-help" instead of "--help".  This is to ensure
compatibility of compiler command line syntax between different ports.

For Tads 3, you don't need to specify where the compiler's include files
are installed.  But the Tads 2 compiler works different.  When invoking
'tadsc', you'll have to use the -i option:

  tadsc -i /usr/local/share/frobtads/tads2 mygame.t

(Remember to use the actual path if you installed somewhere else.)
